[Chapter 2]
source code -> byte code (platform-independent, *.pyc, only for import)
[chapter 4]
	- Numbers: math, random
	- Strings

[Part IV. Functions and Generators]
[Function Basics]
  	- def (executable code, create function object)
  	- lambda (create an object but returns it as a result)
  	- return & yield
  	- global & nonlocal(3.x for enclosing def statement)
	- Python code is not supposed to care about specific data types.

[Scopes]
	-lexical scoping. (local, nonlocal(3.x), global)
		- inside def : local to that function
		- in an enclosing def: nonlocal to nested functions
		- outside all defs: global to the entire file
	- LEGB (Local-Enclosing-Global-Build-in)
		-others: 
			1. temporary loop variables in some comprehensions.
			2. exception reference variables in some try handlers.
			3. local scopes in class statements
	- global
